 * by the pass-through transport implementation. In addition to the usual events handled
 * by the Axis2 MetricsCollector, this implementation handles two new events:</p>
 * <ul>
 *    <li>connected (this should get called whenever a new connection is created)</li>
 *    <li>disconnected (this should get called whenever an existing connection is closed)</li>
 * <ul>
 * <p>These new events are used to update the ConnectionsView at runtime.</p>
