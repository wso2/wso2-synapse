/**
 * This class holds the parameters related to control the connection removal.
 *
 * Scenario:
 * This issue happens when calling salesforce endpoint with keepalive connections. First ESB create the connection with
 * salesforce and send the request and get the response. However if the connection is idle for 1min and ESB used the
 * 1min idle connection to send the next message, salesforce will reset the connection. As a solution to this we decided
 * to introduce a connection eviction mechanism as an improvement. So if a connection is idle for a "connectionIdletime"
 * of time or a connection persisted for more than it's "maximumConnectionLifeSpan" then the connection is removed from
 * the connection pool.
